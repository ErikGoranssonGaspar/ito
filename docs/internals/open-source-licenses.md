# Open source license notices

The desktop renderer build emits `third-party-licenses.json` beside `index.html`. The Settings
page loads that static file. It does not depend on a connected environment or an RPC.

## What the build collects

The generator follows installed production and optional dependencies, including dependencies of
workspace packages, and omits first-party `@t3tools/*` packages. The renderer manifest starts
from the web, server, and desktop package manifests. During the bundle, the generator also checks
emitted module ids to catch a bundled npm import missing from a package manifest.

The build fails when a collected package has no distributable license identifier or contains no
license or notice text. Generated notices use license templates from the pinned SPDX License List.
Strict builds download a missing template into the gitignored `.generated/` cache;
`pnpm licenses:sync` can warm that cache explicitly. Local development does not make a network
request and omits generated rows until the cache exists.

## Custom notices and package overrides

The repository-level `third-party-licenses.config.json` holds manually maintained exceptions for
the desktop app. Add an entry to `customNotices` for adapted icons, fonts, media, native modules, or
another asset that did not come from an npm package:

```json
{
  "name": "asset-name",
  "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
  "generatedNotices": [
    {
      "licenseId": "CC-BY-4.0",
      "preamble": ["Asset by Example Author. Changes: converted to MP3."]
    }
  ],
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/source",
  "bundles": ["assets", "web"]
}
```

Each `generatedNotices` item names an SPDX license template and can add `copyrights` or a short
`preamble` for attribution and provenance. Multiple items are joined into one row for software
that vendors separately licensed code. Keep `noticeFile` or `noticeFiles` only when a vendored
source tree already carries an intrinsic license file that should remain beside it. Paths are
relative to the config file. `bundles` controls which generated manifests include the entry and
supplies the label shown to users. Use `includeInBundles` when the label differs from the
generated manifest that should include the notice.

Use `packageOverrides` only when an installed npm archive omits its notice or has incorrect
metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "package-name",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "generatedNotice": {
    "licenseId": "MIT",
    "copyrights": ["Copyright (c) 2026 Example Author"]
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/package-name"
}
```

`version`, `license`, and `sourceUrl` are optional. Omitting `version` applies the override to every
installed version of that package. An override can use `repositoryUrl` instead of `name` when
several packages from one monorepo share the same notice:

```json
{
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/example/project",
  "generatedNotice": {
    "licenseId": "Apache-2.0"
  }
}
```

The generator also reuses an installed sibling package's notice when both packages declare the
same normalized repository and license. A name-and-version override always wins over these
repository fallbacks.

The `@react-grab/cli` override uses the root React Grab repository's MIT license because the CLI's
npm archive omits both its license field and license file. Keep the override until the published
CLI package carries that metadata itself.

Fetched SPDX templates live under the repository's ignored `.generated/` directory. Do not
commit or edit them; updating dependencies or configuration is enough for the next strict build
to refresh the output.
